\arguments{
\item{means}{Numeric vector of group means.}

\item{sds}{Numeric vector of group SDs (or SEs in the SE/SD-confusion branch).}

\item{ns}{Numeric vector of group sample sizes (integers).}

\item{allow_input_rounding}{Logical vector of length 1 or 2. If TRUE is present,
a branch using ± 0.5 ULP perturbations of means/SDs is created. If FALSE is
present, a branch using the reported values as-is is created.}

\item{se_sd_confusion}{Logical vector of length 1 or 2 indicating whether to
include a branch that treats reported SDs as SEs (converted via SD = SE * sqrt(N)).}

\item{ci_methods}{Character vector of CI methods for partial eta^2. Currently:
\itemize{
\item "none": no CIs (NA).
\item "wald": Wald-type CI on the Fisher-z of the correlation equivalent.
}}

\item{output_rounding}{Character vector of rounding methods for outputs:
\itemize{
\item "half_up"
\item "half_down"
\item "bankers"
\item "truncate"
}}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for CIs (default .05).}

\item{digits_F}{Number of digits for F when rounding outputs.}

\item{digits_p}{Number of digits for p when rounding outputs.}

\item{digits_eta}{Number of digits for partial eta^2 when rounding outputs.}

\item{digits_ci}{Number of digits for CI limits when rounding outputs.}
}
\value{
A list with two data frames:
\describe{
\item{inputs}{Row per (scenario × group) with the "true" cell means, SDs, Ns,
and analytic assumptions (input rounding, SE/SD confusion).}
\item{anova}{Row per (scenario × CI method × output-rounding) with F, df1, df2,
p, partial eta^2, CIs (if any), and all analytic choices.}
}
}
\description{
Explore a multiverse of ANOVA results (F, p, partial eta^2, CIs) compatible
with reported group means, SDs, and Ns under different assumptions:
input rounding (±½ ULP), SE/SD confusion, CI methods, and output rounding.

Implemented degrees of freedom:
\itemize{
\item Input rounding: reported vs ± 0.5 ULP perturbation of means/SDs.
\item SE/SD confusion: reported SDs vs interpreting SDs as SEs (SD = SE * sqrt(N)).
\item CI method: none vs Wald-type CI on the correlation-equivalent scale.
\item Output rounding: half-up / half-down / bankers / truncation
(using \pkg{roundwork}).
}

Not included by design:
\itemize{
\item Alternative effect-size definitions (only partial eta^2).
\item Unequal-variance ANOVA variants.
\item Reconstruction paths other than computing F, p, and partial eta^2
directly from M/SD/N.
