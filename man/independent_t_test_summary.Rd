\arguments{
\item{m1}{Numeric. Mean of Group 1.}

\item{m2}{Numeric. Mean of Group 2.}

\item{sd1}{Numeric. Standard Deviation of Group 1 (assumed sample SD by default).}

\item{sd2}{Numeric. Standard Deviation of Group 2 (assumed sample SD by default).}

\item{n1}{Numeric. Sample size of Group 1.}

\item{n2}{Numeric. Sample size of Group 2.}

\item{d}{Numeric. Reported Cohen's d or Hedges' g estimate.}

\item{d_ci_lower}{Numeric. Reported lower bound of the CI for d.}

\item{d_ci_upper}{Numeric. Reported upper bound of the CI for d.}

\item{d_digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places reported for d/CI.}

\item{p}{Numeric. Reported p-value.}

\item{p_digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places reported for p-value.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level for CIs (default is 0.05).}

\item{ci_methods}{Character vector. CI methods to include.
Allowed: "wald_t", "welch_t", "nct".}

\item{p_methods}{Character vector. P-value methods to include.
Allowed: "student_t", "welch_t".}

\item{output_rounding}{Character vector. Rounding methods applied to both
effect sizes (d/g and CIs) and p-values.
Allowed: "half_up", "half_down", "bankers", "trunc".}

\item{direction}{Character. Whether to compute d as M1 - M2, M2 - M1,
or both. One of "m1_minus_m2", "m2_minus_m1", "both".}

\item{include_se_sd_confusion}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the multiverse also
includes a branch that interprets \code{sd1} and \code{sd2} as standard errors
and converts them to SDs via \eqn{SD = SE \times \sqrt{n}} before computing
effect sizes, CIs, and p-values. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{reproduced}: Data frame summarising whether reported d and p
fall within the multiverse.
\item \code{d_results}: Data frame detailing all calculated effect sizes and CIs.
Contains an additional column \code{sd_interpretation} indicating whether
SDs were used as reported ("sd") or derived from SE ("se_converted").
\item \code{p_results}: Data frame detailing all calculated p-values.
Also includes \code{sd_interpretation}.
}

\description{
This function explores the "multiverse" of possible Cohen's \emph{d} effect sizes,
confidence intervals (CIs), and \emph{p}-values that are compatible with a set
of reported summary statistics (Means, SDs, Ns).

The multiverse is generated by varying:
\itemize{
\item Input Rounding: Adjusting reported statistics by +/- half of the
last decimal place (ULP - Unit in the Last Place).
\item Effect Size Type: Using both Cohen's \emph{d} and Hedges' \emph{g}.
\item CI Methods: Wald-type CIs (using \emph{t} distribution
with pooled/Welch variance) and the Noncentral \emph{t} (NCT) distribution.
\item P-value Methods: Using \emph{t}-tests (Student's pooled or Welch's
unpooled).
\item Output Rounding: Applying different rounding methods ("half_up",
"half_down", "bankers", "trunc") to the final \emph{d}/CI and \emph{p}-value
(governed by the \code{output_rounding} argument).
\item Direction: The calculation uses the direction implied by the order of
the supplied means (M1 - M2).
\item SD vs. SE Interpretation (optional): If \code{include_se_sd_confusion = TRUE},
the function also includes a branch where reported SDs are interpreted as
standard errors and converted to SDs via \eqn{SD = SE \times \sqrt{n}} before
computing \emph{d}, CIs, and \emph{p}-values.
