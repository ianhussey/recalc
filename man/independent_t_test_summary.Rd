\arguments{
\item{m1}{Numeric. Mean of Group 1.}

\item{m2}{Numeric. Mean of Group 2.}

\item{sd1}{Numeric. Standard deviation of Group 1 (assumed sample SD by default).}

\item{sd2}{Numeric. Standard deviation of Group 2 (assumed sample SD by default).}

\item{n1}{Numeric. Sample size of Group 1.}

\item{n2}{Numeric. Sample size of Group 2.}

\item{m_digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places to assume for the reported
means (\code{m1}, \code{m2}). This controls the width of the interval within
which the "true" unrounded mean is assumed to lie.}

\item{sd_digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places to assume for the reported
SDs (\code{sd1}, \code{sd2}). This controls the width of the interval within
which the "true" unrounded SD is assumed to lie.}

\item{input_rounding}{Character. How the input values (\code{m} and \code{sd})
should be treated when generating the multiverse grid. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"truncated"}: Assumes the reported values were truncated.
\item \code{"rounded"}: Assumes the reported values were rounded
(typically +/- 0.5 unit in the last place).
}
Default is \code{"truncated"} if NULL.}

\item{output_rounding}{Character vector. Rounding methods applied to the
calculated results (effect sizes and p-values) to check for matches with
reported values. Allowed: \code{"half_up"}, \code{"half_down"},
\code{"bankers"}, \code{"trunc"}. If \code{NULL}, all are used.}

\item{p}{Numeric. Reported p-value.}

\item{p_digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places to which the p-value was
reported. Must be supplied if \code{p} is non-\code{NULL}.}

\item{p_methods}{Character vector. P-value methods to include.
Allowed: \code{"student_t"}, \code{"welch_t"}.
If \code{NULL}, both are used.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level for CIs (default is 0.05).}

\item{d}{Numeric. Reported Cohen's \emph{d} or Hedges' \emph{g} estimate.}

\item{d_ci_lower}{Numeric. Reported lower bound of the CI for \emph{d}.}

\item{d_ci_upper}{Numeric. Reported upper bound of the CI for \emph{d}.}

\item{d_digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places to which \emph{d} and its CI
bounds were reported. Must be supplied if \code{d} is non-\code{NULL}.}

\item{direction}{Character. Whether to compute the effect as M1 - M2,
M2 - M1, or both. One of \code{"m1_minus_m2"}, \code{"m2_minus_m1"},
\code{"both"}.}

\item{ci_methods}{Character vector. CI methods to include.
Allowed: \code{"wald_t"}, \code{"welch_t"}, \code{"nct"}.
If \code{NULL}, all are used.}

\item{include_se_sd_confusion}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the multiverse also
includes a branch that interprets \code{sd1} and \code{sd2} as standard
errors and converts them to SDs via \eqn{SD = SE \times \sqrt{n}} before
computing effect sizes, CIs, and p-values. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{reproduced}: Data frame summarising whether the reported \emph{d}
and \emph{p} fall within the ranges generated by the multiverse (min/max
rounded values).
\item \code{d_results}: Data frame detailing all calculated effect sizes and
CIs. Contains additional columns such as \code{sd_interpretation},
indicating whether SDs were used as reported (\code{"sd"}) or derived
from SE (\code{"se_converted"}), and rounding indicators.
\item \code{p_results}: Data frame detailing all calculated p-values.
Includes \code{sd_interpretation}, \code{p_unrounded},
\code{p_rounded}, and match indicators.
}

\description{
This function explores the "multiverse" of possible Cohen's \emph{d} effect sizes,
confidence intervals (CIs), and \emph{p}-values that are compatible with a set
of reported summary statistics (Means, SDs, Ns).

The multiverse is generated by varying:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Input Rounding/Grid generation}: Adjusting reported statistics
(Means and SDs) by creating a grid of potential "true" values within
the precision limits defined by \code{m_digits} and \code{sd_digits}.
This relies on the \code{input_rounding} argument to determine if the
values should be treated as "rounded" (interval +/- 0.5 ULP) or
"truncated".
\item \strong{Effect Size Type}: Computing both Cohen's \emph{d} and Hedges' \emph{g}.
\item \strong{CI Methods}: Calculating Wald-type CIs (using \emph{t} distributions
with pooled or Welch variance) and Noncentral \emph{t} (NCT) distribution CIs.
\item \strong{P-value Methods}: Using \emph{t}-tests (Student's pooled or Welch's
unpooled).
\item \strong{Output Rounding}: Applying different rounding methods
("half_up", "half_down", "bankers", "trunc") to the calculated
\emph{d}/CI and \emph{p}-value to compare against the reported values.
\item \strong{Direction}: The calculation uses the direction implied by the
order of the supplied means (M1 - M2) or its reverse, depending on
\code{direction}.
\item \strong{SD vs. SE Interpretation (optional)}: If
\code{include_se_sd_confusion = TRUE}, the function includes a branch
where reported SDs are interpreted as standard errors and converted to
SDs via \eqn{SD = SE \times \sqrt{n}}.
