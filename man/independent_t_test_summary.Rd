effect sizes, CIs, and p-values. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{reproduced}: Logical. TRUE if a combination of calculated
and rounded \emph{d} and CIs matches the reported ones.
\item \code{d_results}: Data frame detailing all calculated effect sizes and CIs.
Contains an additional column \code{sd_interpretation} indicating whether
SDs were used as reported ("sd") or derived from SE ("se_converted").
\item \code{p_results}: Data frame detailing all calculated p-values.
Also includes \code{sd_interpretation}.

\description{
This function explores the "multiverse" of possible Cohen's \emph{d} effect sizes,
confidence intervals (CIs), and \emph{p}-values that are compatible with a set
of reported summary statistics (Means, SDs, Ns).

The multiverse is generated by varying:
\itemize{
\item Input Rounding: Adjusting reported statistics by +/- half of the
last decimal place (ULP - Unit in the Last Place).
\item Effect Size Type: Using both Cohen's \emph{d} and Hedges' \emph{g}.
\item CI Methods: Wald-type CIs (using \emph{z} or \emph{t} distribution
with pooled/Welch variance) and the Noncentral \emph{t} (NCT) distribution.
\item P-value Methods: Using \emph{t}-tests (Student's pooled or Welch's
unpooled) or \emph{z}-approximations (pooled or Welch).
\item Output Rounding: Applying different rounding methods ("half_up",
"half_down", "bankers", "trunc") to the final \emph{d}/CI/p-value.
\item Direction: The calculation uses the direction implied by the order of
the supplied means (M1 - M2).
\item SD vs. SE Interpretation (optional): If \code{include_se_sd_confusion = TRUE},
the function also includes a branch where reported SDs are interpreted as
standard errors and converted to SDs via \eqn{SD = SE \times \sqrt{n}} before
computing \emph{d}, CIs, and \emph{p}-values.
