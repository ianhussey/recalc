\arguments{
\item{m1}{Numeric. Mean of Group 1.}

\item{m2}{Numeric. Mean of Group 2.}

\item{sd1}{Numeric. Standard deviation of Group 1 (assumed sample SD by default).}

\item{sd2}{Numeric. Standard deviation of Group 2 (assumed sample SD by default).}

\item{n1}{Numeric. Sample size of Group 1.}

\item{n2}{Numeric. Sample size of Group 2.}

\item{m_digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places to assume for the reported
means (\code{m1}, \code{m2}) when constructing the +/- 0.5 ULP adjustment
grid. This controls the width of the interval within which the unrounded
mean is assumed to lie. If \code{NULL}, no adjustment grid is generated
for the means (i.e., the reported means are treated as exact).}

\item{sd_digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places to assume for the reported
SDs (\code{sd1}, \code{sd2}) when constructing the +/- 0.5 ULP adjustment
grid. This controls the width of the interval within which the unrounded
SD is assumed to lie. If \code{NULL}, no adjustment grid is generated for
the SDs (i.e., the reported SDs are treated as exact).
Note that specifying \code{m_digits} and \code{sd_digits} defines only the
size of the rounding unit; the actual rounding rule for the original
reporting (e.g., round half up vs truncate) is not constrained and is
implicitly allowed to be anything whose outputs fall within the +/- 0.5 ULP
interval.}

\item{output_rounding}{Character vector. Rounding methods applied to both
effect sizes (\emph{d}/\emph{g} and CIs) and p-values.
Allowed: \code{"half_up"}, \code{"half_down"}, \code{"bankers"}, \code{"trunc"}.
If \code{NULL}, all are used.}

\item{p}{Numeric. Reported p-value.}

\item{p_digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places to which the p-value was
reported. Must be supplied if \code{p} is non-\code{NULL}.}

\item{p_methods}{Character vector. P-value methods to include.
Allowed: \code{"student_t"}, \code{"welch_t"}.
If \code{NULL}, both are used.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Significance level for CIs (default is 0.05).}

\item{d}{Numeric. Reported Cohen's \emph{d} or Hedges' \emph{g} estimate.}

\item{d_ci_lower}{Numeric. Reported lower bound of the CI for \emph{d}.}

\item{d_ci_upper}{Numeric. Reported upper bound of the CI for \emph{d}.}

\item{d_digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places to which \emph{d} and its CI
bounds were reported. Must be supplied if \code{d} is non-\code{NULL}.}

\item{direction}{Character. Whether to compute the effect as M1 - M2,
M2 - M1, or both. One of \code{"m1_minus_m2"}, \code{"m2_minus_m1"},
\code{"both"}.}

\item{ci_methods}{Character vector. CI methods to include.
Allowed: \code{"wald_t"}, \code{"welch_t"}, \code{"nct"}.
If \code{NULL}, all are used.}

\item{include_se_sd_confusion}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the multiverse also
includes a branch that interprets \code{sd1} and \code{sd2} as standard
errors and converts them to SDs via \eqn{SD = SE \times \sqrt{n}} before
computing effect sizes, CIs, and p-values. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{reproduced}: Data frame summarising whether the reported \emph{d}
and \emph{p} fall within the ranges generated by the multiverse.
\item \code{d_results}: Data frame detailing all calculated effect sizes and
CIs. Contains additional columns such as \code{sd_interpretation},
indicating whether SDs were used as reported (\code{"sd"}) or derived
from SE (\code{"se_converted"}), and \code{d_rounded},
\code{ci_lower_rounded}, \code{ci_upper_rounded} for each combination
of analytic choices and output rounding.
\item \code{p_results}: Data frame detailing all calculated p-values.
Includes \code{sd_interpretation}, \code{p_unrounded},
\code{p_rounded}, and indicators of whether the rounded p-value
matches the reported one under each rounding rule.

\description{
This function explores the "multiverse" of possible Cohen's \emph{d} effect sizes,
confidence intervals (CIs), and \emph{p}-values that are compatible with a set
of reported summary statistics (Means, SDs, Ns).

The multiverse is generated by varying:
\itemize{
\item Input Rounding: Adjusting reported statistics by +/- half of the
last decimal place (ULP - Unit in the Last Place), as specified by
\code{m_digits} and \code{sd_digits}. This implicitly allows any
rounding rule whose result lies within this interval (from truncation
toward negative infinity up to truncation toward positive infinity);
the rounding mechanism for the input M and SD cannot be restricted
to a single specific rule.
\item Effect Size Type: Using both Cohen's \emph{d} and Hedges' \emph{g}.
\item CI Methods: Wald-type CIs (using \emph{t} distributions with pooled or
Welch variance) and the Noncentral \emph{t} (NCT) distribution.
\item P-value Methods: Using \emph{t}-tests (Student's pooled or Welch's
unpooled).
\item Output Rounding: Applying different rounding methods ("half_up",
"half_down", "bankers", "trunc") to the final \emph{d}/CI and \emph{p}-value
(governed by the \code{output_rounding} argument).
\item Direction: The calculation uses the direction implied by the order of
the supplied means (M1 - M2) or its reverse, depending on
\code{direction}.
\item SD vs. SE Interpretation (optional): If
\code{include_se_sd_confusion = TRUE}, the function also includes
a branch where reported SDs are interpreted as standard errors and
converted to SDs via \eqn{SD = SE \times \sqrt{n}} before computing
\emph{d}, CIs, and \emph{p}-values.
