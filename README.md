# recalc



## Ideas for scope

### Within scope

Recalculation of statistical results from reported results.

Calculating discrete values or intervals of possible values of a given statisics (e.g., test stat, p value, effect size) given different assumptions about the reported values (e.g., summary stats). 

- For example, given reported M and SD for both experimental and control conditons, what range of cohen's d values are consistent with this result, given (a) different rounding, (b) method of calculating cohen's d.

### Out of scope

Some of the more inferential tests about the flagging (possible) errors.



## Ideas for features

- Consider rounding in reported results.
